HSICS_TCI
Simulations for testing Multispectral Compressive Imaging Strategies
====================================================================

This Matlab package comes as supplemental material for the paper 
K. Degraux, V. Cambareri, Bert Geelen, Laurent Jacques, Gauthier Lafruit,
Multispectral Compressive Imaging Strategies using Fabry-Pérot Filtered 
Sensors, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging, 2018

The CAVE dataset can be downloaded at

Unzip the toolboxes (spot-master and tight_subplot).
Launch hsics_setup, then hsics_main(jobid) with jobid between 0 and 705 to 
reproduce results presented in the paper. For more information on the jobid 
and the output files, see hsics_jobid.

The function HSinspector is useful to display and explore 3D arrays.

The code was tested on MATLAB R2016b on Mac OS X 10.10.5 and on 
MATLAB R2015a compiled with MCC and ran with MCR on a Linux workstation.
